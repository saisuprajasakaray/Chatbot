# Chatbot
**Overview**

This project implements a basic chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The chatbot is designed to recognize user intents and respond accordingly based on predefined patterns and responses.


**Technologies Used**

Python: Programming language used.

NLTK: For tokenization and text processing.

scikit-learn: For machine learning model (Logistic Regression) and text vectorization (TF-IDF Vectorizer).

**Installation**

Clone the Repository:


git clone
https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git

cd 
chatbot-project

Install Required Packages:

pip install nltk scikit-learn

Download NLTK Data: Run the following code in Python to download necessary NLTK data:


import nltk
nltk.download("punkt")

**Usage**

Run the Chatbot: Execute the script to start interacting with the chatbot:

python chatbot.py

Interact with the Chatbot: Enter a query in the console and the chatbot will provide a response based on the intent detected.


**How It Works**

Data Preparation: The chatbot uses a list of intents with patterns and responses. Each pattern corresponds to a user query, and each response is a possible reply from the chatbot.


Text Vectorization: The TF-IDF Vectorizer converts text data into numerical format suitable for the machine learning model.


Intent Classification: The Logistic Regression classifier is trained to predict the intent of user queries based on the vectorized input.

Response Generation: Based on the predicted intent, the chatbot selects a random response from the predefined set of responses.

Example
User Input: "Hi"

Chatbot Response: "Hello"
